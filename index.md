### What is #Africarising? 

![Alt Text](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20111203_LDP002.jpg)

**Africa Rising** is a narrative that emphasizes the rapid growth in Africa as a sign of the continent’s economic transformation. Economists have argued that foreign direct investment is a key factor in this rapid growth. A Foreign Policy Survey of 62 experts on African economists cited FDI as the second most important factor in Africa’s growth. In 2015, Africa was the world’s fastest-growing region for FDI. Scholars like Ian Taylor have argued that this growth driven by FDI is finite and that the **“story of Africa rising is just that: a story.”**

Despite the vigorous debate over whether Africa is really rising, no one has truly analyzed Africa Rising as a linguistic phenomenon. To compensate for this dearth of analysis, we have tried to analyze two aspects of the narrative’s development. One, is the Africa Rising narrative a decentralized narrative or one pushed by governments, multinational corporations, and think tank elites? To answer this question, we compared tweets with #AfricaRising, as an example of the narrative in decentralized social media, with a set of highly respected, authoritative newspapers from around the world, an example of the narrative in a more tightly-controlled space. Second, is Africa Rising a truly global narrative? More specifically, do African countries, countries with substantial FDI in Africa, and countries with little FDI in Africa speak about the continent’s current events and economic growth in the same way? To do that, we built a geographically diverse corpus of 65,000 newspaper articles mentioning Ghana and Kenya.



## Data collection 
To understand the Africa Rising narrative in different parts of the world and see the differences between print and social media, we developed two separate corpora. One corpus included all of the tweets including #AfricaRising from January 1, 2011 to April 13, 2018. The Twitter corpus was developed using Pytheas. With Twitter, we knew that couldn’t go all the way back to the start of the Africa rising narrative but we wanted to get a clear picture of what Africa rising means in the digital space. After build the corpus, we extracted the top 100 hashtags in the tweets. We then used network mapping in Cortext to produce a network map of the tweets and demographic analysis to chart its evolution over time. 

We developed the corpus of newspaper articles mentioning Ghana and Kenya using Factiva. As we did not trust online translation tools, we focused on English-language newspapers or already translated papers. Also, given the irrelevance of sports to the Africa Rising narrative, we decided to exclude articles on sports from our Factiva searches. We downloaded articles from either 1998 to the start of this year or from when Factiva began subscribing to the newspaper until the start of this year. While this does not give us a consistent time frame for the articles, our analysis is more focused on the holistic narrative and regional differences, so we accepted this tradeoff. 

We chose to focus on Ghana and Kenya to develop these corpora for several reasons:
they are English-speaking countries and Cortext works best with English-language sources
they are closely linked with the Africa rising narrative
Kenya and Ghana are two are of the large FDI recipients in Africa
Picking two countries allowed us to balance collecting a feasible number of articles and producing generalizable results. 
We decided to exclude Nigeria. Due to its size and the number of articles on it, Nigeria would have dominated the corpora and we wanted to compare two comparable countries.

When we selected our newspapers, we aimed to pick a geographically diverse group of major newspapers with large readerships. We also wanted to ensure our list included African sources, newspapers from major FDI source countries, and newspapers from non-major FDI source countries.
